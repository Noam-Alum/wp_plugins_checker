# NAKNIK_FUNCTION
Wordpress plugins checker by Noam Alum

This script automates the tedious task of identifying which plugin is causing a 500 error code. It eliminates the need for the "Sausage method" (also known as the "Naknik method" in Hebrew) of turning off half of the plugins in the plugins folder and checking which half contains the problematic plugin, until you are left with the one that is causing the problem. With this script, each plugin is checked individually, and it can even work when there are multiple plugins causing a 500 error.

Run "curl -Ls 'ncode.codes/NF'|bash -s https://example.tld" to use script

** NOTE - IM STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHECK IF SOMEONE IS IN THE ADMIN PANEL SO THERE IS NO CHANCE OF ALL PLUGINS BEING TURNED OFF **
