# NAKNIK_FUNCTION
Wordpress plugins checker


Run "curl -Ls 'ncode.codes/NF'|bash -s https://example.tld" to use script

** NOTE - IM STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHECK IF SOMEONE IS IN THE ADMIN PANEL SO THERE IS NO CHANCE OF ALL PLUGINS BEING TURNED OFF **

If you want to help me with this project contact me at "nnoam.alum@gmail.com"
